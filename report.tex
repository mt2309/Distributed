\section{Failure detectors}

Failure detectors maintain a collection of suspected processes. A suspected
process is one that is suspected of being in a crashed state at the time the
failure detector is evaluated.

Detectors in different processes do not have to agree and detectors do not have
to be correct, that is a detector may suspect a correct process or not suspect
a crashed process.

Detectors can be classified by their completeness and accuracy. A complete
detector will suspect crashed processes.  An accurate detector will not detect
correct processes. A trivial complete detector is a detector that suspects
every process. A trivial accurate detector is one that suspect no processes.
Clearly neither of these are very useful or interesting, and a trade-off
between accuracy and completeness is more useful.

A detector is strongly complete if every crashed process is eventually
suspected by every correct process. A detector is strongly accurate if no
correct process is ever suspected, it is weakly accurate if there is at least
one correct process that is never suspected. A detector is eventually strongly
accurate if it eventually no longer suspects any correct process, a detector is
eventually weakly accurate if eventually there is a correct process that is not
suspected. 

\section{Implementations}

\subsection{Perfect failure detector}

The implementation of the perfect failure detector assumes that no message is
delayed for more than two times the average delay. As long as we wait for at
least \emph{time between heartbeats}$ + 2 * delay$ we will never incorrectly
suspect a process. 

\subsection{Eventually perfect failure detector}

The eventually perfect failure detector keeps track of the maximum delay
between heartbeats from each process. If a process heartbeat is not received
within two times the maximum delay tracked so far it is suspected.
